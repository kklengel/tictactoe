#Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a well known game by many computer enthusiasts. This project was made for a task
at the MMBBS.

## How to Use

Start the game by entering any number from 1 to 9 into the prompt.

+ Beginning player will always be 'X'
+ Enter number from "1 - 9" to choose a field (Fields are numbered from top left to bottom right)
+ If you choose a blocked field, its your turn again
+ type "end" at any time to finish the application early.

## Demonstration

For demonstration purposes there is a link to a go playground in the package "demo".
It's basically all files combined into one without the endless loop because playground does not allow endless loops. 


## Design Pattern
This project implements the state pattern.
